## Overview
This project provides hands-on experience in building a comprehensive API testing framework using Rest Assured and TestNG. Key aspects include:

- **API Testing Fundamentals:** Understanding HTTP methods, status codes, and request-response workflow.  
- **Test Automation Framework:** Developing a robust framework using Java and TestNG.
- **BDD Style Testing:** Structuring tests with clear Given/When/Then steps to improve readability and maintainability.  
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Generating dynamic datasets at runtime using JavaFaker to validate different input scenarios efficiently.
- **TestNG Integration:** Utilizing TestNG for test configuration, execution, and reporting.  
- **API Documentation:** Creating clear documentation for the tested API endpoints.
